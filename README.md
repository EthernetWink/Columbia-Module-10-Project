# Columbia-Module-10-Project

# Usage

In this project we are provided crypto data and are tasked with using unsupervised learning to clister the data.
The first thing we do is k_means the raw data and we get our spread out cluster.
Next, we use PCA on the data to see which components really impact the grouping. 
Then we group by those components rather than the raw data.

# Outcome

This provides us with an understanding of hour our features are grouped together before and after using PCA.
The hvplots provide a very nice visualization for us.
